The skills you will acquire after completing this course are as follows:
1) Basic HTML and HTML5
HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
2) Basic CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. 
3) Applied Visual Design
Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message.
4) Responsive Web Design Principles
Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions.
5) CSS Flexbox
With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically.
6) CSS Grid
The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to build complex responsive layouts. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid, and lets you place child elements anywhere within.
